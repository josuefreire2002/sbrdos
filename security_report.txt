System check identified some issues:

WARNINGS:
?: (axes.W003) You do not have 'axes.backends.AxesStandaloneBackend' or a subclass in your settings.AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS.
	HINT: AxesModelBackend was renamed to AxesStandaloneBackend in django-axes version 5.0.
?: (axes.W004) You have a deprecated setting AXES_META_PRECEDENCE_ORDER configured in your project settings
?: (security.W004) You have not set a value for the SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS setting. If your entire site is served only over SSL, you may want to consider setting a value and enabling HTTP Strict Transport Security. Be sure to read the documentation first; enabling HSTS carelessly can cause serious, irreversible problems.
?: (security.W008) Your SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT setting is not set to True. Unless your site should be available over both SSL and non-SSL connections, you may want to either set this setting True or configure a load balancer or reverse-proxy server to redirect all connections to HTTPS.
?: (security.W009) Your SECRET_KEY has less than 50 characters, less than 5 unique characters, or it's prefixed with 'django-insecure-' indicating that it was generated automatically by Django. Please generate a long and random value, otherwise many of Django's security-critical features will be vulnerable to attack.
